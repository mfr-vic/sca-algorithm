# Sine Cosine Algorithm : 
This algorithm implementation in python proposes to solve optimization problems with different randomization methods.

The SCA creates multiple initial random candidate solutions and requires them to fluctuate outwards or towards the best solution using a mathematical model based on sine and cosine functions.
